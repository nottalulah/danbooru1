ANIMUS

Animus, the Spear of Courage, was crafted by the quarti Thoma as a
gift to Diegas for being the bravest of the primi.  Diegas used the
spear to defeat an army of secundi that were invading Primus.  It is
the greatest weapon that Thoma ever created, and it is arguably the
strongest weapon to have ever existed in the inner worlds.  When
Aeneas died, Diegas buried Animus alongside his friend in a mountain
in Secundus.

THE DROUGHT

The Drought refers to the extended period of time in which the primi
used so much tone as to cause a tone deficit in Secundus.  It roughly
corresponds to the Age of Tyrants in Primus, and the years 1500 AD
through 2010 AD in Secundus.

THE SECOND ORDER

The Second Order is a covert organization of sorcerers.  It was
originally founded during the Achaemenid Empire in 500 BC, and was at
one point the largest organization of sorcerers in the known world.
At the height of their power they established chapters in every major
continent, and they enjoyed appreciable influence on local politics.
The rise of the Temple decimated their power.  Presently there is only
one practicing member: Ishikura Saku.

THE SEALING

The Sealing refers to the event in which Sariel destroyed all the tone
sinks in Primus and blocked the tone river from flowing into Primus.

THE TEMPLE 

The Temple are an ancient organization based in Secundus.  They were
originally an organization of sorcerers, but following the witch hunts
of the 16th century the Holy Roman Church coerced them into hunting
sorcerers.

The Temple is organized in an absolute hierarchy.  At the very top is
the Matriarch, who determines general policy and prioritizes targets.
Next are the hunters, who go out and hunt down sorcerers.  At the very
bottom are the various administrative staff.

Ever since the Drought began the Temple have decreased in numbers.  In
the present age the Temple only has a dozen members.

Members: Nigel Ward (England), Otto Luetke (Germany), Lady O'Harris
(Canada), Svetlana Mankowski (Canada), Tobi Parkins (United States),
Kimberly Miller (United States), Jinsoo Rhee (Korea), Hansung Rhee
(Korea), Francesca Bella (Italy), Junde Kuriko (Japan), Sawa Sei
(Japan), Sonia LeVrai (France).

The current Matriarch is Junde Kuriko.
