                             THE CREATION
                             ------------

In the beginning, there was only Nihilum.  Nihilum uttered the words,
"I am," and Nihilum became Ego.  Where before there was nothing,
now there was something.  There was identity.  And with identity came
all the things necessary for identity: space, time, causality,
substance, other.  All these things formed the totality of existence.

Ego created eight worlds: Primus, Secundus, Tertius, Quartus, Quintus,
Sextus, Septimus, and Octavus.  Ego filled the eight worlds with
mountains, rivers, deserts, seas, vast continents and archipelagos.
Ego created day and night, the sky and the stars, the sun and the
moon.

But Ego was not content.  Ego sought companions.  So Ego created life.

Ego imbued the dust with the first force, animus, the will to life.
From the dust life sprung forth, fully formed and perfectly conceived.
Sprawling vines and towering trees, beasts and leviathans of every
size, shape, and color.

But still Ego was not satisfied.

Ego continued to create, to form creatures that were increasingly like
Ego.  To man, the most ambitious of Ego's creations, Ego granted the
gifts of knowledge and wisdom.  Man could now build tools, they could
learn, write, teach, build farms, cities, empires.

The first men built temples to honor and worship Ego, and at first Ego
was pleased.  Elaborate rituals were devised and the choicest harvests
were offered up in sacrifice.

But soon, the familiar feeling of loneliness returned.  Ego sought not
worshippers, but fellow creators.

Ego sought to make man more like Ego, more like a god.  Ego granted
man the gift of natura, the fundamental substance that made up the
universe.  The Primi were the first to use this power to ascend to
godhood, followed soon by the Secundi, the Tertii, and the Quarti.

Finally, Ego thought, I will have companions.

But the gods bored Ego.  Most of them remained reverent; they
continued their ceremonies and their sacrifices.  A few gods rebelled,
but they were too consumed with destruction to ever use their powers
for creation.  Ego could not even muster the strength to be angry.
Instead, Ego decided that there was no point in continuing.

Ego left the universe.

With no one to watch over them, the Tertii and the Quarti terrorized
the outer worlds, subjugating them to harsh and cruel rule.  When the
Secundi rebuked them, a terrible war ensued.  Millions perished as the
gods waged their war across all eight worlds.

The Primi, fearing the destruction of the universe, erected the Wall
of Heaven.  The wall served as a barrier between the outer and inner
worlds.  Passage through the wall was strictly forbidden.

To ensure that the wall would never be breached, the Primi created the
Contract.  The Contract promised the outer worlds that the gods would
never interfere in their affairs, provided that two simple conditions
were met: never cross the wall and never ascend to godhood.  The three
laws were engraved on four tablets and the tablets were given to the
four wisest men in the outer worlds.


                               SEPTIMUS
                               --------

THE ENDOWMENT

Ursus was the eldest son of a minor noble family that had fallen on
hard times.  From his destitute family he inherited a small tract of
land in the country.  Ursus decided to make the best of his situation
and moves out to live his life as a farmer.

He married a local girl and together they had three sons: Hericus,
Ricus, and Adamas.  Their first three years on the farm were extremely
difficult, and Ursus's wife would not live to see the fruits of their
labor--she died of dysentery.  Ursus struggled to keep the farm alive
and to feed and shelter his children.

Finally, in their fifth year, their harvest was bountiful enough to
keep them fed throughout the long winter season.  When Ursus's sons
were old enough, they began helping their father with the farm work,
and eventually the four began to live comfortably.

Ursus, who strongly believed in the value of education, began to teach
his sons how to read and write.  Hericus and Ricus only learned enough
to satisfy their father, but Adamas was different.  He voraciously
read everything his father gave him, and soon he longed to visit the
great libraries his father fondly spoke of.

When Adamas was twenty, the Primi descended upon Septimus and granted
Ursus possession of one of the tablets.  From the tablet Ursus learned
the secrets of sorcery.  He immediately recognized the danger inherent
in such power and decided that the tablet had to be destroyed.

But Adamas argued with his father, saying that the tablet could be
used for immense good.  With sorcery, all the suffering in the world
could be alleviated.  But Ursus refused to listen and set off on a
journey to Cinis Mons, where he planned to cast away the tablet into
the deepest gorge in Septimus.

Adamas covertly followed his father, and just as Ursus was about to
throw away the tablet Adamas once again argued with his father.  When
his stubborn father ignored his son's pleas, Adamas struck Ursus and
seized the tablet from him.  But Adamas underestimated his own
strength, for his blow had killed Ursus.

Adamas grieved his father's death.  But he remained determined about
using sorcery to improve the world.  He took the tablet and returned
home.  Adamas reluctantly told his brothers that their father had
slipped and fallen into the gorge.  The two brothers, who respected
Adamas, believed him.  On his father's grave, Adamas vowed that his
death would not be in vain.

Adamas taught himself sorcery, and upon mastering all that the tablet
could teach him, he taught Ricus and Hericus.  Together, the three
brothers set out to unite the disparate kingdoms of the world under
one empire.


THE THREE BROTHERS' WAR

In the years following the Contract, peace reigned over Septimus.  The
world was divided between five major kingdoms.  Each king enjoyed
absolute power over his domain.  While border disputes and skirmishes
were common, they never escalated into full scale war.

But even without war, the people lived hard lives.  Droughts and
famines were frequent, and even the poorest among them were taxed
heavily.  Literacy was restricted to the noble-born.

From the outset, Adamas was convinced that the five kings would not
listen to reason, and would never enact progressive reforms.  Instead,
Adamas decided he had to display an immense display of force to cow
the king into surrendering unconditionally.

While Hericus and Ricus acted as generals and contributed to the war,
the bulk of the planning was led by Adamas.  None of the three
brothers were particularly good strategists, and they fell prey to
countless pincer attacks.  It was only through sorcery that they were
able to last so long.

The war lasted a total of six years and caused over a million deaths.
But in the end, the three brothers were able to defeat the five kings.
Adamas named their new empire Ursa Terra, after their father, and
crowned himself the new emperor.


THE FIRST EMPIRE

Adamas worked tirelessly to improve the empire.  He used sorcery to
ward off droughts and floods.  He cured diseases, and helped farmers
increase their yield.  But Adamas had his limits.  For all his power,
he was still only one man, and the empire was too large for him to
administer.

Adamas began to delegate work to others.  He designed a multi-tiered
government and sought the most intelligent men of the empire to govern
his people.

But Adamas was a poor judge of character.  By his third year,
corruption had become rampant.  Adamas's advisors (led chiefly by
Craeus) provided distorted reports that failed to capture the
deteriorating state of the empire.  Adamas remained blissfully
ignorant of the famine that had struck the southern reaches of the
empire during his third year, and during his fourth year his slow
response to a cholera epidemic resulted in thousands of needless
deaths.  The people, who had never approved of Adamas in the first
place, grew increasingly restless.

On one of his hunting trips, Hericus spent a night in a far away
village.  While staying there, Hericus fell in love with a young girl
named Isabella.  The two slept together and Isabella became pregnant
with Hericus's child.  Fearing his brother's wrath, Hericus used a
spell to erase Isabella's memory.  When the villagers learned of her
pregnancy, they blamed a demon and cast her out of the village.
Isabella eventually gave birth to Diegas in a river, but she did not
live to see her son's face.

A passing hunter found the orphaned Diegas and pitied him.  He adopted
the child as his own son.

From an early age Diegas demonstrated immense strength.  Diegas could
overpower his own father, and for fun he would wrestle with bears in
the woods.  When Diegas was of age, he became notorious for seducing
girls.  Despite their rage the fathers were helpless to stop him,
because this young boy could defeat the strongest among them.

When Diegas turned sixteen his exasperated father told him that he was
now a man and had to act more responsible.  He gave Diegas a pouch
full of gold and told him to travel and use his great strength for
good.  Despite his mischief, Diegas loved his father and decided to
take his words to heart.

Diegas traveled to the city of Aruntas, where rumors of corrupt
governors were widespread.  Without so much as issuing a challenge,
Diegas barged into the castle and murdered everyone inside.  He seized
the governor's rod, a symbol of absolute authority, and declared
himself the ruler of a new empire.


THE CIVIL WAR 

The people, who were tired of Adamas's governors, rallied behind
Diegas.  Diegas was a brilliant strategist, and despite his inferior
numbers he was able to take several major cities and forts.  By the
time Adamas learned of the uprising it was already too late; Diegas
had gained too much momentum to be quelled without a major war.

Adamas sought to resolve the conflict through diplomacy.  He viewed
Diegas as little more than a barbarian and was loath to grant him any
concessions, but he realized some sacrifices had to be made to avoid
major bloodshed.

Adamas sent Ricus as an envoy to Diegas, offering independence as long
as he promised to serve the empire.  But Diegas had little interest in
serving anyone.  In order to incite war, Diegas slayed Ricus and sent
his head back to Adamas.

Diegas's plan worked as intended.  The enraged Adamas vowed to destroy
the barbarian emperor and to crush the uprising.

Despite all his years of ruling, Adamas was still an incompetent
general.  Once again he had to rely on sorcery to stay even in the
war.  Diegas, despite having the favor of the people and the advantage
of superior tactics and leadership, struggled to get past the
immensely destructive sorcery the three brothers wielded.

The sexti Thoma, who up until now had been watching Diegas's rise to
power with amusement, decided to intervene.  In order to offset
Adamas's sorcery, he gave Diegas the legendary spear Ferox.  Not only
was Ferox strong enough to destroy mountains, but it also granted its
wielder limited immortality.

With spear in hand, Diegas led the charge against one of the major
Ursan strongholes, Natrus.  Ferox easily destroyed the fortress walls
and Diegas's army slaughtered the Ursan soldiers.  With Natrus in
their possession, Diegas was now within striking distance of the Ursan
capital.




THE SECOND EMPIRE



Upon hearing of Diegas's coronation, the sexti prince Norman sends an
army to attack Primus.  Using Animus, Diegas defeats the army
single-handedly, thus cementing his reputation as the strongest
warrior of the four inner worlds.

In retaliation for the attack, Diegas travels to Secundus with the
intention of conquering it.  He battles the secundi, defeating all of
them easily.  Adria runs up to Diegas and begs him to free her husband
Aeneas.  She explains that the secundi feared Aeneas's strength and
threatened Adria's life unless Aeneas chained himself to a cliff.

Diegas agrees to help Adria, but only if she sleeps with him.  Adria
agrees.  The following day, Diegas sets off to the cliff and frees the
man.  Adria embraces Aeneas, then weeps and tells him what Diegas did
to her.  Aeneas attacks Diegas in a rage.  The two fight, but are
interrupted when Malor, god of the sea, attacks them.  Diegas and
Aeneas work together to defeat Malor.  Diegas deals the killing blow
with Animus.  Aeneas is impressed by Diegas's courage, and vows to
become his friend.

Diegas and Aeneas travel to Tertius.  They hear stories of Jana,
allegedly the most beautiful of the terti.  Diegas and Aeneas sneak
into her bedroom.  Jana, who was never content with her husband Hugo,
allows herself to be seduced by the two and sleeps with them.  The
next morning when Hugo finds the two in his wife's bed, in a blind
rage he attacks Jana and kills her.  Upon learning of his daughter's
death, Hieromias declares war on Hugo home land.

Diegas and Aeneas travel to Quartus, but the quarti learn of their
approach beforehand and hide.  The two primi find an empty world.
They wander the land and eventually come across the Tree of Stone.
Diegas chops it down.  The demon Weiyu is freed.  It ravages the world
and all the quarti come out to curse Diegas for his foolishness.
Diegas battles Weiyu with Animus and finally kills it.  From the
demon's hide Diegas crafts Koushul, the Armor of Living Stone.

Diegas and Aeneas travel to the World Wall.  Diegas pounds on the wall
for eighty days, but even he cannot break it.

Diegas and Aeneas return to Primus.  Aeneas pines for his wife and
begs Diegas to let him return to Secundus, but Diegas refuses.  Diegas
gathers the most beautiful women in Primus and offers them as a gift
to Aeneas.  The men of Primus complain, but Diegas kills them.

Saad learns of the chaos Diegas and Aeneas caused on Quartus and
Tertius, and in anger he sends the strongest of the quarti, Gravax, to
rebuke the two.  Gravax arrives at Primus and challenges Aeneas to a
battle (knowing that he is the weaker of the two).  Aeneas reluctantly
agrees and is slain in battle.  Diegas laments the death of his
friend, and uses Animus to slay Gravax.

Diegas climbs the highest mountain in Secundus and buries his friend
there, along with Animus.  Overwhelmed by grief, Diegas goes on a
rampage, killing hundreds of gods.  After a year of this abuse, the
primi finally choose eight men and women to rise up and defeat Diegas.
The eight heroes are: Sariel, Atax, Buchial, Ishur, Hadrus, Imalon,
Grundel, and Ona.  The eight travel to Quartus to seek audience with
the gods there for their blessing.

Saad sees an opportunity to eliminate Diegas and agrees to arm the
eight with powerful weapons.  The heroes return to Primus and after a
lengthy journey arrive at Diegas's castle.  They battle him for seven
days and seven nights.  Sariel finally lands a mortal blow with her
sword Victus.  Diegas utters a world-shaking death cry.

Faced with the prospect of returning to their homes to live mundane
lives, Hadrus, Buchial and Atax decide to instead replace Diegas and
rule Primus for themselves.  They invite Sariel, Ishur and Imalon to
join them.

A brief war ensues when Ona and Grundel fight to gain their own
territory.  In the aftermath, the known world is carved up into eight
kingdoms, one for each of the former heroes.  The Age of Tyrants
begins.


THE TYRANTS

Atax, Buchial, Hadrus, Sariel, Ishur, Grundel, Imalon, and Ona
establish the kingdoms of Radia, Stonemorrow, Corion, Aes, Namida,
Vale, Crevytch, and Shalon, respectively.

Atax implements draconian laws to consolidate and solidify his power.
He establishes a secret police and allows them to indiscriminately
arrest and execute suspected criminals.  Buchial and Hadrus adopt
similar policies.

Grundel, still bitter at his rejection by the others, starts venting
his frustrations on his people.  Rumors of depraved nightly parties in
which dozens of children disappear become common.  People are executed
and tortured in public every day, and the streets are lined with
decaying bodies.  Grundel befriends Ona and she begins to adopt his
sadistic personality.

Sariel, Ishur, and Imalon are far more lenient in their rule.  Sariel
and Ishur mostly neglect their duties and allow wealthy plutarchs to
fill in the power gap.  These surrogate rulers build merchant states
that, while increasing the class gap, are a far cry from the
nightmarish states of Radia and Stonemorrow.  To his credit Imalon
tries to implement several progressive reforms, but his naivete allows
his underlings to exploit him.

The tyrants give frequent offerings to the terti and the quarti to
placate them (Diegas had killed off most of the powerful secundi).
The tyrants easily quash the infrequent rebellions.  For at least
three centuries, history remains static.

A sorcerer named Lauran living in Crevytch manages to escape detection
long enough to summon a tone sink.  He uses this tone sink to summon
a demon from Quartus called Nimrod.
                                 
Lauran orders Nimrod to destroy the tyrant kings.  Instead, Nimrod
goes rampant and starts destroying everything in sight.  He ends up
destroying half the world before the combined effort of Atax, Buchial,
and Sariel finally kill the demon.  In retribution, the tyrant kings
condemn Lauran to an eternity of being eaten alive by pigs.

Atax reprimands Imalon and tells him to make sure an incident like
this never happens again.  But Imalon ignores Atax's warning.

Atax, Buchial, and Hadrus begin experimenting with summoning monsters
from the outer worlds.  These monsters typically wreak havoc on the
human villages.  Among the worst of the summoned monsters: trolls,
seraphs, golems, dragons, dreamthieves, and chudras.

Three decades before the end of age of tyrants, Beriol gives birth to
Itan.  Throughout his youth children ridicule him for not having a
father, but with his mother's encouragement Itan learns to ignore
them.  He buries himself in history books.  He reads ancient texts
from the age of gods: Isrevar, Porticus, Machs, and Dunloper.  Itan
soon comes to despise the tyrant kings and all the oppression that
they represent.  But as a mediocre sorcerer, he knows that he hasn't a
chance of standing up to them.

Itan buries himself in research.  Among the mountain of obscure books
Sariel has in her library, Itan finds a treatise by Valgis, a sorcerer
from the age of gods.  In it Itan finds one of the most thorough
explanation of tone networks ever written.

Using recent research, Itan is able to resolve the major issues Valgis
found with tone networks.  Itan creates a new network with some of his
closest friends.  They manage to keep the network a secret for over a
decade.  By then the network has grown to over a hundred members.

On the tenth year anniversary of the network, Itan decides to go
public with the network.  He establishes the Free Guild and calls for
all sorcerers to join him in the fight against tyranny.

Imalon reacts harshly.  He attacks the Guild, but is repelled.  Using
all the tone the Guild had generated over the span of a decade, Itan
lands a killing blow against Imalon, annihilating him.  Itan declares
the kingdom of Crevytch to be free from tyranny and vows to defeat the
other tyrant kings.

The other tyrant kings are alarmed but are too afraid to do anything.
Sariel decides to invite Itan for dinner.  Itan explains his belief
that the tyrants are stifling the growth of Primus.  In the 500 years
the tyrants have ruled, there has been virtually no progress made in
magical research.  Despite the power of sorcery, millions of people
are starving or suffering from disease.  Literacy is low, monsters
roam the countryside, and the people live in constant fear.  Sariel is
convinced by Itan and agrees to help him rid Primus of the tyrants.

Sariel helps Itan recharge their network (which was nearly depleted
after their battle with Imalon).  The Guild immediately sets out to
attack Grundel.  Meanwhile, Sariel travels to the tone river to see if
the flow of tone can somehow be blocked.

Atax realizes the gravity of the situation and gathers the other
tyrants with the intention of fighting against the Guild together.
Ona receives the call but instead decides to flee to Secundus.

Sariel discovers a way to seal the tone river, effectively destroying
every tone sink in Primus.  She does so, but dies in the process.  The
tyrants are crippled and despite their massive reserves are easily
defeated by the Guild, now four thousand members strong.

The age of tyrants comes to an end.


THE GUILD
