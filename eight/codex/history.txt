                             THE CREATION
                             ------------

In the beginning, there was only Nihilum.  Nihilum uttered the words,
"I am," and Nihilum became Ego.  Where before there was nothing,
now there was something.  There was identity.  And with identity came
all the things necessary for identity: space, time, causality,
substance, other.  All these things formed the totality of existence.

Ego created eight worlds: Primus, Secundus, Tertius, Quartus, Quintus,
Sextus, Septimus, and Octavus.  Ego filled the eight worlds with
mountains, rivers, deserts, seas, vast continents and archipelagos.
Ego created day and night, the sky and the stars, the sun and the
moon.

But Ego was not content.  Ego sought companions.  So Ego created life.

Ego imbued the dust with the first force, animus, the will to life.
From the dust life sprung forth, fully formed and perfectly conceived.
Sprawling vines and towering trees, beasts and leviathans of every
size, shape, and color.

But still Ego was not satisfied.

Ego continued to create, to form creatures that were increasingly like
Ego.  To man, the most ambitious of Ego's creations, Ego granted the
gifts of knowledge and wisdom.  Man could now build tools, they could
learn, write, teach, build farms, cities, empires.

The first men built temples to honor and worship Ego, and at first Ego
was pleased.  Elaborate rituals were devised and the choicest harvests
were offered up in sacrifice.

But soon, the familiar feeling of loneliness returned.  Ego sought not
worshippers, but fellow creators.

Ego sought to make man more like Ego, more like a god.  Ego granted
man the gift of natura, the fundamental substance that made up the
universe.  The Primi were the first to use this power to ascend to
godhood, followed soon by the Secundi, the Tertii, and the Quarti.

Finally, Ego thought, I will have companions.

But the gods bored Ego.  Most of them remained reverent; they
continued their ceremonies and their sacrifices.  A few gods rebelled,
but they were too consumed with destruction to ever use their powers
for creation.  Ego could not even muster the strength to be angry.
Instead, Ego decided that there was no point in continuing.

Ego left the universe.

With no one to watch over them, the Tertii and the Quarti terrorized
the outer worlds, subjugating them to harsh and cruel rule.  When the
Secundi rebuked them, a terrible war ensued.  Millions perished as the
gods waged their war across all eight worlds.

The Primi, fearing the destruction of the universe, erected the Murrus
Caeles.  The wall served as a barrier between the outer and inner
worlds.  Passage through the wall was strictly forbidden.

To ensure that the wall would never be breached, the Primi created the
Pactum.  The Pactum promised the outer worlds that the gods would
never interfere in their affairs, provided that three simple
conditions were met: never cross the wall, never ascend to godhood,
and never cross between the worlds.  The three laws were engraved on
four tablets and the tablets were given to the four wisest men in the
outer worlds.


                               SEPTIMUS
                               --------

In the years following the Pactum, peace reigned over Septimus.  Five
kings, all of them claiming to be descendants of a Primi god, divided
the world into five major kingdoms.  Each king enjoyed absolute power
over his domain.

Life for the common man was harsh.  The poorest among them suffered
from heavy taxes, and the farmers could barely grow enough food to
feed themselves, let alone their lords.


THE ENDOWMENT

Twenty years before the Pactum:

Ursus was the eldest son of a minor noble family that had fallen on
hard times.  From his destitute father he inherited a small tract of
land in the country.  Ursus decided to make the best of his situation
and moved out to live his life as a farmer.

He married a local girl and together they had three sons: Hericus,
Ricus, and Adamas.  Life on the farm was a struggle, and their first
three years were the worst.  Ursus's wife died soon after giving birth
to Adamas.

All of Ursus's toiling finally paid off in the fifth year, when the
harvest was plentiful enough to keep his family fed throughout the
long winter season.  When Ursus's sons were old enough, they began
helping their father with the farm work, and eventually the four began
to live comfortably.

Ursus began to teach his sons how to read and write.  Hericus and
Ricus only learned enough to satisfy their father, but Adamas was
different.  He voraciously read everything his father gave him and
soon was as skilled as his father was.

When Adamas was twenty, the Primi descended upon Septimus and granted
Ursus possession of one of the tablets.  From the tablet Ursus learned
the secrets of sorcery.  He immediately recognized the danger inherent
in such power and decided that the tablet had to be destroyed.

But Adamas argued with his father, saying that the tablet could be
used for immense good.  With sorcery, all the suffering in the world
could be alleviated.  But Ursus refused to listen and set off on a
journey to Cinis Mons, where he planned to cast away the tablet into
the deepest gorge in Septimus.

Adamas covertly followed his father, and just as Ursus was about to
throw away the tablet Adamas once again argued with his father.  When
his stubborn father ignored his son's pleas, Adamas struck Ursus and
seized the tablet from him.  But Adamas underestimated his own
strength, for his blow had killed Ursus.

Adamas grieved his father's death.  But he remained determined about
using sorcery to improve the world.  He took the tablet and returned
home.  Adamas reluctantly told his brothers that their father had
slipped and fallen into the gorge.  The two brothers, who respected
Adamas, believed him.  On his father's grave, Adamas vowed that his
death would not be in vain.

Adamas taught himself sorcery, and upon mastering all that the tablet
could teach him, he taught Ricus and Hericus.  Together, the three
brothers set out to unite the disparate kingdoms of the world under
one empire.


THE DOMINATE

The first three centuries of the Ursan Empire are referred to as the
Dominate period, named for the Dominus moniker that the Imperators
adopted.  It was a time of great hardship, as the empire was in almost
constant war against neighboring countries.  Anyone who could lift a
sword was drafted into the army and sent to the frontlines.


IMPERATOR DOMINUS ADAMAS

From the outset, Adamas was convinced that the twelve kings would
never enact progressive reforms.  Adamas decided he had to display an
immense display of force to cow the king into surrendering
unconditionally.  He believed that only he had the strength to bring
the world out of darkness.

Adamas was careful to keep the tablet well guarded.  The last thing he
wanted was the knowledge of sorcery to escape his family.  But in
order to use his powers most effectively he had to be at all the major
battles, and so he left daily administration of the empire to his two
brothers. 

Ricus, the youngest brother, was eager to please Adamas, and he took
his role as Consul seriously.  But despite his enthusiasm, he was
still a naive young boy at heart, and almost all of his decisions were
influenced by elder advisors like Craeus and Telemus.  As Ricus grew
increasingly bored of statecraft, he began to delegate more and more
responsibility to the two advisors.

Craeus and Telemus loathed each other.  The more power they gained,
the more they bickered with each other.  The struggle culminated in
Telemus's assassination.  While Craeus denied any wrongdoing,
Telemus's followers weren't convinced and vowed vengeance.

Hericus had no interest in his civic duties as the Arbiter of the
Ursan Empire.  He was more interesting in hunting, and he let his wife
Anila handle the task of being Arbiter.

To her credit Anila was a shrewd and fair woman.  The Arbiter was
mainly tasked with handling court trials and managing foreign affairs,
and Anila considered herself qualified for the task.  But the other
men of the court were not nearly so 



IMPERATOR DOMINUS SIDEREUS

Sidereus was the first to implement the soon to become popular policy
of severely restricting access to sorcery.  He created a secret police
to hunt down and kill suspected sorcerers.  Sidereus used sorcery to
cement and consolidate his power base.  But it was mundane treachery
that ultimately ended his reign; his childhood friend Laerus betrayed
him so that his son Atreus would inherit the empire.  Sidereus ruled
for a little under a decade.


IMPERATOR DOMINUS ATREUS

Atreus (acting as a proxy for his father Laerus for most of his early
life) continued Sidereus's policy of hunting down sorcerers.  Atreus
also continued Adamas's military campaigns, expanding the Ursan empire
greatly.  Atereus's rule was the second longest after Adamas.  


IMPERATOR DOMINUS ARCUS

Arcus was an incompetent Imperator who squandered the trust and
goodwill his father had generated among the people.  


THE PRINCIPATE

The four centuries following the Dominate period are referred to as
the Principate.  It was a time of relative peace and prosperity.

When Diegas abolished the Imperial Mandate, the Imperator role was
dismantled along with it.  In its place the concept of the Princeps
was born.  The Princeps was mostly a figurehead role and held little
actual power.  Daily administration was left for the new Consulate,
comprised of thirty consuls, each consul serving a term of five years.


THE TYRANNATE

THE REPUBLICA


In his mind Adamas conceived of a perfect empire.  A world without
drought or famine, without disease, with bountiful harvests and mild
weather.  He had never given any thought to how he would build this
utopia.  He simply presumed his sorcery would be enough.

But the sheer scale of running an empire overwhelmed Adamas.  His
sorcery could help one or two cities, but not an entire empire.
Adamas hastily enlisted the aid of governors to help him with
administrative work.  He sought out the best and brightest of the
empire and granted them autonomous control over their regions.

Adamas had always been a poor judge of character, and the men he chose
to serve him all invariably abused their power.  The people, who had
never approved of Adamas in the first place, grew increasingly
restless.

While Adamas struggled with the empire, Hericus and Ricus lived
carefree lives.  Neither of the two brothers had interest in their
civic duties.  Hericus in particular was more interested in hunting
than ruling, and he spent most of his days roaming the countryside on
his many hunts.  Ricus spent his youth chasing after girls and living
the aristocrat's life.

On one of his hunting trips, Hericus spent a night in a far away
village.  While staying there, Hericus fell in love with a young girl
named Isabella.  The two slept together and Isabella became pregnant
with Hericus's child.  Fearing his brother's wrath, Hericus used a
spell to erase Isabella's memory.  When the villagers learned of her
pregnancy, they blamed a demon and cast her out of the village.
Isabella eventually gave birth to Diegas in a river, but she did not
live to see her son's face.

A passing hunter found the orphaned Diegas and pitied him.  He adopted
the child as his own son.

From an early age Diegas demonstrated immense strength.  Diegas could
overpower his own father, and for fun he would wrestle with bears in
the woods.  When Diegas was of age, he became notorious for seducing
girls.  Despite their rage the fathers were helpless to stop him,
because this young boy could defeat the strongest among them.

When Diegas turned sixteen his exasperated father told him that he was
now a man and had to act more responsible.  He gave Diegas a pouch of
gold and told him to travel and use his great strength for good.
Despite his mischief, Diegas loved his father and decided to take his
words to heart.

Diegas traveled to the city of Aruntas, where rumors of corrupt
governors were widespread.  Diegas barged into the castle and killed
all the governors that were assembled there.  He declared himself the
new emperor and vowed to bring an end to Adamas's corrupt rule.

Even though they knew almost nothing about the man, the people rallied
behind Diegas.  Diegas proved to be a brilliant strategist and despite
his inferior numbers he was able to take several major cities and
forts.  By the time Adamas learned of the uprising it was already too
late; Diegas had gained too much momentum to be quelled without a
major war.

Adamas was convinced that Diegas was a threat and had to be
eliminated.  He mobilized the Ursan army and launched an attack, but
suffered a series of crippling defeats.  Adamas resorted to using his
sorcery once more, but Diegas proved more cunning than any of the five
kings had ever been.  The two sides reached a stalemate.

Adamas called upon the sexti to aid him, knowing full well that this
was a breach of the Pactum.  Norman, a sexti blacksmith, responded to
Adamas's call.  Norman sought to test Adamas's dedication by demanding
the sacrifice of one of his brothers.  Adamas had grown increasingly
resentful of his brothers over the years for failing to help him run
the empire.  Adamas marked Ricus for the sacrifice and Norman reaped
Ricus's soul.  In exchange he granted Adamas possession of the spear
Aegulus.  Adamas triumphantly returned to his home with the spear,
convinced he now had the power to slay Diegas.

Adamas sent a challenge to Diegas, demanding a man-to-man fight.
Diegas accepted the challenge.  Adamas planned to use Aegulus to kill
Diegas and bring a swift conclusion to Diegas's rebellion.

Hericus was enraged that Adamas so callously gave up Ricus to the
sexti.  In retribution, Hericus stole Aegulus.  On the day of the
fight, Hericus gave the spear to Diegas.  Diegas used the spear to
easily slay Adamas.  Diegas declared himself the new Imperator.


IMPERATOR DIEGAS

It did not take long for Diegas to return to his old habits.  He
shamelessly abused his power to sleep with women, and he left the
daily administration of the empire to his underlings, who were no more
scrupulous when it came to using their powers.

The sexti realized that the Primi had failed to punish Norman for
breaching the Pactum.  The four sexti kings sent an invading army to
Septimus.

Diegas took up Aegulus and set out to defend Septimus from the sexti.
He defeated the sexti armies by his own strength.  In retaliation for
the attack, Diegas traveled to Sextus and fought all the great sexti
warriors.  He emerged victorius.

Adria, a sexti woman, ran up to Diegas and begged him to free her
husband Aeneas.  She explained that the sexti feared Aeneas's strength
and threatened Adria's life unless Aeneas chained himself to a cliff.

Diegas agreed to help Adria, but only if she slept with him.  Adria
agreed.  The following morning, Diegas set off to the cliff and freed
Aeneas.  Adria embraced her husband, then wept and told him what
Diegas did to her.  Aeneas attacked Diegas in a rage.  The two fought,
but were interrupted when Malor, god of the sea, attacked them.
Diegas and Aeneas worked together to defeat Malor.  Diegas dealt the
killing blow with Aegulus.  Aeneas was impressed by Diegas's courage,
and vowed to become his companion.

Diegas and Aeneas traveled to Quintus.  They heard stories of Jana,
allegedly the most beautiful of the quinti.  Diegas and Aeneas snuck
into her bedroom.  Jana, who was never content with her husband Hugo,
allowed herself to be seduced by the two and slept with them.  The
next morning Hugo found the two in his wife's bed.  In a blind rage he
attacked Jana and killed her.  Upon learning of his daughter's death,
Hieromias declared war on Hugo's home land.  Diegas and Aeneas quietly
left Quintus to visit the Murrus Caeles.

Diegas pounded on the wall for eighty days and eighty nights, but even
he could not break it.

Diegas and Aeneas returned to Septimus.  Aeneas pined for his wife and
begged Diegas to let him return to Sextus, but Diegas refused.  Diegas
gathered the most beautiful women in Septimus and offered them as a
gift to Aeneas.  The septimi complained, but Diegas killed them.

Saad, a quinti king, learned of the chaos Diegas and Aeneas had
caused.  In anger he sent Gravax, a strong quinti warrior, to punish
the two.  Gravax arrived at Septimus and challenged Aeneas to a battle
(knowing that he was the weaker of the two).  Aeneas reluctantly
agreed.  After a long battle, Gravax slayed Aeneas.  In a rage, Diegas
pierced Gravax's heart with Aegulus, killing him.

Diegas climbed the highest mountain in Sextus and buried Aeneas there,
along with Aegulus.  He then returned to his home in Septimus.  Diegas
was overwhelmed with grief.  He went on a rampage, killing hundreds of
men.  After a year of this abuse, the septimi decided that they had
had enough.  They chose eight men and women to rise up and defeat
Diegas.  The eight heroes were: Sariel, Atax, Buchial, Ishur, Hadrus,
Imalon, Grundel, and Ona.

Saad saw an opportunity to eliminate Diegas and agreed to arm the
eight with powerful weapons.  After a lengthy journey the eight heroes
arrived at Diegas's castle.  They battled him for seven days and seven
nights.  In the end, Diegas surrendered and yielded to the heroes.
The heroes demanded that Diegas banish himself from Septimus, and he
obeyed.

Faced with the prospect of returning to their homes, Hadrus, Buchial
and Atax decided to instead replace Diegas and rule Septimus for
themselves.  They invited Sariel, Ishur and Imalon to join them.

A brief war ensued when Ona and Grundel fought to gain their own
territory.  In the aftermath, the known world was carved up into eight
kingdoms, one for each of the former heroes.  The Age of Tyrants had
begun.


AGE OF TYRANTS

Atax, Buchial, Hadrus, Sariel, Ishur, Grundel, Imalon, and Ona
established the kingdoms of Radia, Stonemorrow, Corion, Aes, Namida,
Vale, Crevytch, and Shalon, respectively.

Atax implemented draconian laws to consolidate and solidify his power.
He established a secret police and allowed them to indiscriminately
arrest and execute suspected criminals.  Buchial and Hadrus adopted
similar policies.

Grundel, still bitter at his rejection by the others, started venting
his frustrations on his people.  Rumors of depraved nightly parties in
which dozens of children disappeared became common.  People were
executed and tortured in public every day, and the streets were lined
with decaying bodies.  Grundel befriended Ona and she began to adopt
his sadistic personality.

Sariel, Ishur, and Imalon were far more lenient in their rule.  Sariel
and Ishur mostly neglected their duties and allowed wealthy plutarchs
to fill in the power gap.  These surrogate rulers built merchant
states that, while increasing the class gap, were a far cry from the
nightmarish states of Radia and Stonemorrow.  To his credit Imalon
tried to implement several progressive reforms, but his naivete
allowed his underlings to exploit him.

The tyrants gave frequent offerings to the sexti and the quinti to
placate them.  The tyrants easily quashed the infrequent rebellions.
For at least three centuries, history remained static.

In the fourth century, a sorcerer named Lauran living in Crevytch
managed to escape detection long enough to summon a tone sink.  He
used this tone sink to summon a demon from Quintus named Nimrod.
                                 
Lauran ordered Nimrod to destroy the tyrant kings.  Instead, Nimrod
went rampant and destroyed everything within sight.  He ended up
destroying half the world before the combined effort of Atax, Buchial,
and Sariel finally slayed the demon.  In retribution, the tyrant kings
condemned Lauran to an eternity of being eaten alive by wolves.

Atax reprimanded Imalon and told him to make sure an incident like
this never happened again.  But Imalon ignored Atax's warning.

Atax, Buchial, and Hadrus began experimenting with summoning monsters
from the inner worlds.  These monsters typically wreaked havoc on the
human villages.  Among the worst of the summoned monsters were trolls,
seraphs, golems, dragons, dreamthieves, and chudras.

In the twelth century, Beriol was chosen as the successor to Itrus,
who had served as Sariel's advisor for nearly two centuries before
deciding to retire.

Beriol gave birth to Itan.  Throughout his youth children ridiculed
him for not having a father, but with his mother's encouragement Itan
learned to ignore them.  He buried himself in history books.  He read
ancient texts: Isrevar, Porticus, Machs, and Dunloper.  Itan soon came
to despise the tyrants and all the oppression that they represented.

Among the mountain of obscure books Sariel had in her library, Itan
found a treatise by Valgis, an ancient sorcerer.  In it Itan found one
of the most thorough explanation of tone networks ever written.

Using recent research, Itan was able to resolve the major issues
Valgis found with tone networks.  Itan created a new network with some
of his closest friends.  They managed to keep the network a secret for
over a decade.  By then the network had grown to over a hundred
members.

On the tenth year anniversary of the network, Itan decided to go
public.  He established the Guild and called for all sorcerers to join
him in the fight against tyranny.

Imalon reacted harshly.  He attacked the Guild, but was repelled.
Using all the tone the Guild had generated over the span of a decade,
Itan landed a killing blow against Imalon, annihilating him.  Itan
declared the kingdom of Crevytch to be free from tyranny and vowed to
defeat the other tyrants.

The other tyrants were alarmed but were too afraid to do anything.
Sariel decided to invite Itan for dinner.  Itan explained his belief
that the tyrants were stifling the growth of Septimus.  In the 500
years the tyrants have ruled, there has been virtually no progress
made in magical research.  Despite the power of sorcery, millions of
people were starving or suffering from disease.  Literacy was low,
monsters roamed the countryside, and the people lived in constant
fear.  Sariel was convinced by Itan and agreed to help him rid
Septimus of the tyrants.

Sariel helped Itan recharge their network (which was nearly depleted
after their battle with Imalon).  The Guild immediately set out to
attack Grundel.  Meanwhile, Sariel traveled to the tone river to see
if the flow of tone can somehow be blocked.

Atax realized the gravity of the situation and gathered the other
tyrants with the intention of fighting against the Guild together.
Ona received the call but instead decided to flee to Octavus.

Sariel discovered a way to seal the tone river, effectively destroying
every tone sink in Septimus.  The tyrants were crippled and despite
their massive reserves were easily defeated by the Guild, now four
thousand members strong.

The age of tyrants came to an end.
