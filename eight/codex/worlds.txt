There are eight worlds in existence: Primus, Secundus, Tertius,
Quartus, Quintus, Sextus, Septimus, and Octavus.  Of these only the
first two are well known, and virtually nothing is known of the last
four.

Inhabitants of the eight worlds are called: primi, secundi, terti,
quarti, sexti, septi, and octavi.  These words also function as
adjectives (i.e. primi history).

The eight worlds exist in separate universes and travelling between
the worlds is only possible with powerful sorcery.

Thousands of years ago, the octavi erected a wall between Quartus and
Quintus, blocking all travel between the inner worlds and the outer
worlds.  This wall is called the World Wall.

Secundus mostly parallels Earth in the early twenty-first century.
Aside from the prehistory, the timelines are also identical.

The history of Primus is divided into three major periods: the Age of
Gods, the Age of Tyrants, and the Age of Iron.
