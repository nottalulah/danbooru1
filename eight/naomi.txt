"What are you doing this weekend?  You don't look like the partying

"Uh...okay."

I'm not about to turn down an opportunity to sit next to a pretty
woman.

I sit down next to her and do my best not to stare.

"Wait.  Don't tell me.  The two of you were walking outside when it
suddenly began to rain.  You ran inside but it was too late and your
clothes got wet.  You didn't want her to catch a cold so you took her
