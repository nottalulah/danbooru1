When I arrive at the train station I find it empty aside from a young
woman sitting in one of the benches.  There's no one else here.  I
walk past the woman, intending to sit down at that nice looking bench
at the far end of the platform, when I hear a voice call out behind
me.

"Where are you going?"

"Eh?"

I turn around.  The woman is staring at me.

"Sit down."

I'm not about to turn down an opportunity to sit down next to a pretty
woman.

As I start to approach her, I get to take a good look at her.  She's
wearing fancy clothes: a black miniskirt, a blouse that looks one size
too small for her chest, and glossy black high heels.  Her hair is
radiant even underneath the pale light of the street lamps, and her
face...

"Wait a minute."

"What?" she says.

"Naomi?  Is that you?"

"Duh?  Who'd you think I was?"

"I could barely recognize you."

She smiles.

"Do I look good?"

"Like a million bucks."

"I wish you would've dressed up a little, too."

I look down at my clothes.  I'm wearing an old t-shirt and some faded
blue jeans.

"I didn't know this was gonna be a fancy party," I say.

"It's not really.  I just wanted to dress up for once.  You may not
believe this, but I don't go out to parties often.  Usually I just
stay at home."

"Brooding about global warming?"

"No, nothing like that.  I go out like this maybe once a month."  She
pauses to laugh.  "Usually it's Mayu who drags me around.  She's a
total party animal."

The platform begins flashing as the train arrives.  We board it and
find a seat in the back.  There's no one on the train.

"Where do we get off?" I ask.

"Shiba.  That's three stops.  Be sure to keep count.  I always miss my
stop."

I look out the window as the scenery rushes by.
